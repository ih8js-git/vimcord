## About

> [!NOTE]
> A Terminal UI Discord Client in Rust.

### Terms of Service Notice
>
> [!WARNING]
> Under no circumstances should you use a Discord User Token (also known as a self-bot token) with this software or any associated tools.

Discord's [Terms of Service (ToS)](https://discord.com/terms) explicitly and strictly prohibit the use of User Tokens for programmatic access or self-botting. Violation of these terms can lead to permanent termination of your Discord account.

> - **Do not use self-bots or user-bots.** Each account must be associated with a human, not a bot.
> Self-bots put strain on Discord’s infrastructure and our ability to run our services. For more information, you can read our Developer Policies [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy).

The developers, contributors, and maintainers of this repository disclaim all liability and responsibility for any and all consequences that may arise from a user's decision to violate Discord's Terms of Service.

> [!CAUTION]
> We do not encourage, endorse, or support the use of User Tokens.
>
> The user assumes all risk for any account actions, bans, or penalties issued by Discord due to improper use of this software.
